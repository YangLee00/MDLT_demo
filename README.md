# MDLT_demo
A simple implementation of paper "A Dual-Scale Lead-Separated Transformer with Lead Orthogonal Attention and Meta-information for ECG Classification" 

Code is coming.

In order to reproduce the results in the paper, you need to download PTB-XL dataset, preprocess the data to 100Hz numpy array follow paper 《Deep Learning for ECG Analysis: Benchmarks and Insights from PTB-XL》, and then run the main ipynb file after modifying your task and numpy array path.
