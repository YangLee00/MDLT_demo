# MDLT_demo
A simple implementation of paper "MDLT: A Multiple Attention Dual Scale Lead Independent Transformer for ECG classification" 

Code is coming.

In order to reproduce the results in the paper, you need to download PTB-XL dataset, preprocess the data to 100Hz numpy array follow paper 《Deep Learning for ECG Analysis: Benchmarks and Insights from PTB-XL》, and then enter main Ipynb file, modify your task and numpy array path.

Then, run it!
